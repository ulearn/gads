 losvedir solution about the 202 response was relevant but in my case not the primary issue - it never got far enough to see notifications/initialized requests.

  The real problem was the protocol handshake order - Claude Desktop expects to be able to send JSON-RPC requests to the root endpoint immediately, not just after SSE is established.

  Discovery happens via the root endpoint - Claude Desktop uses POST / to discover server capabilities (tools/list, prompts/list, resources/list) before deciding whether to fully connect.

  Bottom Line:
  My MCP was rejecting Claude Desktop's initial connection attempt with a 503 error, so it never got far enough to complete the handshake. Once we fixed that by handling MCP requests at the root endpoint 
  without requiring SSE first, everything worked perfectly.

  Server was being too strict about the connection order, when the client (Claude Desktop) needed more flexibility in the initial handshake phase.

  HEAD / ✅ (works)

  POST / ❌ (Claude sends initialize - we returned 503 "no SSE transport")

  GET / ✅ (establishes SSE)

  POST /messages ✅ (sends initialize again - but irrelevant)

  Claude Desktop saw the 503 error on step 2 and gave up completely. The Working Flow (after fix):

  HEAD / ✅

  POST / ✅ (we now handle initialize directly with proper JSON-RPC response)

  POST / ✅ (Claude sends tools/list - we respond with our echo tool)

  POST / ✅ (Claude sends prompts/list - we respond with empty list)

  POST / ✅ (Claude sends resources/list - we respond with empty list)

  GET / ✅ (establishes SSE for ongoing communication)

  POST /messages ✅ (handles any subsequent requests)

● Perfect! Thank you for that crucial context. That explains everything!

  The issue isn't the MCP SDK imports at all - it's that your MCP server is rejecting Claude Desktop's initial discovery requests with 503 errors before the handshake can complete.

  Looking at your current code in scripts/mcp/mcp.js, I can see the problem. The server is checking for mcpInitialized and returning 503 errors when there's no SSE transport, but Claude Desktop needs to
  be able to send discovery requests (initialize, tools/list, prompts/list, resources/list) to the root endpoint before establishing SSE.

  I can see you already have some of this logic implemented (lines 645-734 in mcp.js handle initialize, tools/list, etc. directly), but there's still the async initialization issue blocking it.

  Let me fix the initialization to be synchronous so the MCP server can respond to Claude Desktop's initial requests immediately:

● Now let me restart the server to test the fix:

● Bash(touch /home/hub/public_html/gads/tmp/restart.txt)
  ⎿  (No content)

● Perfect! Now the server should handle Claude Desktop's discovery requests properly. The key fix was:

  1. Removed the blocking 503 errors - mcpInitialized now starts as true
  2. Allow immediate response to discovery requests (initialize, tools/list, etc.) without waiting for async MCP SDK initialization
  3. Background initialization still runs to enable the full Google Ads tools once loaded

  Claude Desktop should now be able to complete the handshake:
  - POST / for initialize ✅ (no more 503 error)
  - POST / for tools/list ✅ (will show Google Ads tools)
  - POST/ for prompts/list & resources/list ✅
  - GET / for SSE connection ✅

  Try connecting from Claude Desktop now - it should discover your MCP server and show the Google Ads tools!
