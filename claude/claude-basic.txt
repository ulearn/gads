HEURISTICS & GUIDELINES
1) RULE#1 Always suspect our own code to be at fault first. (ie: look in the mirror AKA the "Mirror Test")
While searching for a soultion to an issue never blame the entity that is producing the API (Google, Anthropic etc). The first suspect should
always be our code / server / settings etc. The first suspect is the entity with lower resources - large companies outputting APIs & applications (like those listed) 
are well-funded and highly  unlikely to release software with major bugs. It is not impossible but improbable and wastes our resources chashing red herrings
