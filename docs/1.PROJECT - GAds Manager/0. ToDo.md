1. Clone the PMax Campaigns according to the Blueprint 
    - You're gonna need translations of Assets in the Asset Groups
    - You're gonna need analysis again of the Audience Targeting in those Groups:
        - Seem to have 3 Asset Groups
            - Each has a different Audience: 
            1) Schools (kinda lookalike audience I guess)  
            2) Fidelo - probably a tiny sampler 
            3) Interests - seems to be where the real Google Action is... Higher volume perhaps 
            * I think we can improve on this now - throw some AI at it 
    - Create dynamic headlines in one of the Asset Headlines - see how it performs


2. Fix the ROAS Prediction Dashboard (just bring it into line with Revenue ROAS - ensure it's using the Google Ads Campaign field and any other new fields we rolled out)

3. Remarket => Create a new Audience based on validated SQLs only
    - This is a good start place 
    - You could segment further afterwards  perhaps => First real mission is to get them out of Responsive - Spend the money there
