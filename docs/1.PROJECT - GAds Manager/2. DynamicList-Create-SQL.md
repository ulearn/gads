OFFSITE DYNAMIC Sales Qualified Lead (SQL) Contact List 

To avoid billing in HubSpot we're gonna push SQLs to a List that grows / shrinks over time. 

I guess I could pretty easily offsite these contacts into a larger list and from there upload API sync to Google right? Rather than paying HubSpot for the pleasure of pushing data to GoogleAds#

Would you like me to show how to filter only marketing contacts to stay under that quota? Ah! Right ok... so these must be marketing contacts... So we have 2,000 max right now and that should generally be sufficient to target active leads in the pipeline - the 12k contacts are nearly all historical (mainly LOST and others WON) but we are not interested in those - we just want the active ones and preferably the ones earlier in the Pipeline - the key waystage is getting Leads out of Stage2 "Sequenced" and into stage 3 "Engaging" but especially Stage4 - "Responsive" At any one time I expect us to have a couple hundred in those target stages between Inbox/Engaging/Sequenced/Responsive and the later stages when human sales are involved Advising/Negotiation/Trial Is there a way to ensure we keep this figure below 2000? Probably adding filters to the Segment based on pipeline Stages will do it organically but interested to know if we can hard cap it so we dont' go over and incur costs


==========================================

Exactly üíØ ‚Äî that‚Äôs the smart (and free) route.

You don‚Äôt need HubSpot‚Äôs paid Ads sync at all ‚Äî you can offsite the contacts, then upload or sync them directly to Google Ads through your own script or API.

Here‚Äôs how to do it cleanly üëá

üß© 1. Export your contacts from HubSpot

Use your Active List (SQL + high-value LOST).
Export as CSV including:

email
first_name
last_name
phone
country


(These fields align with Google‚Äôs Customer Match schema.)

‚öôÔ∏è 2. Upload via Google Ads UI (simple)

Go to Tools & Settings ‚Üí Shared Library ‚Üí Audience Manager ‚Üí Segments ‚Üí Customer lists ‚Üí +

Choose ‚ÄúUpload emails and/or phone numbers‚Äù

Upload your CSV

Name it (e.g. SQLs_HighValue_Lost_Ulearn)

That‚Äôs manual but free and works fine if updated monthly.

‚öôÔ∏è 3. Automate via API (recommended)

You already run Node.js, so you can automate it easily:

Use HubSpot API ‚Üí /crm/v3/objects/contacts/search
(Filter by deal stage and territory.)

Push to Google Ads API ‚Üí Customer Match (UserListService)

That gives you a scheduled, automatic sync every night/week, no HubSpot Marketing Pro required.

‚úÖ 4. Result

Fully free sync.

No HubSpot ad-seat cost.

Still totally compliant with Google‚Äôs first-party match rules.

Would you like me to show a ready-to-run Node.js example that pulls your SQL list from HubSpot and uploads it to Google Ads Customer Match automatically?
=====================
Yeah - 100% needs to automated - we wanna be hammering these ads at contacts the moment they enter that pipeline 
=====================



Perfect ‚úÖ ‚Äî that‚Äôs the right mindset. You‚Äôve already got the tech stack for this (Node.js + HubSpot private app + Google Ads API access), so we can wire it together easily.

Here‚Äôs the architecture for your automated SQL ‚Üí Google Ads Customer Match sync üëá

üß© System Overview
Component	Function
HubSpot API	Pull latest contacts filtered by pipeline stage + territory
Node.js script (server)	Formats contacts ‚Üí hashes data ‚Üí uploads to Google Ads
Google Ads API	Maintains a live ‚ÄúCustomer Match‚Äù audience
Scheduler (cron / PM2)	Runs every few hours to keep it fresh
‚öôÔ∏è Step-by-step setup
1. Create a Google Ads Customer Match audience

In Ads UI:
‚Üí Tools ‚Üí Shared Library ‚Üí Audience Manager ‚Üí Segments ‚Üí Customer lists ‚Üí + New
‚Üí Choose ‚ÄúUpload via API‚Äù (just give it a name like ulearn_sql_sync).

Copy the Customer Match UserList ID (you‚Äôll need it in the script).

2. HubSpot side

You‚Äôll use your private app token and query deals/contacts like:

https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/contacts/search


Filter:

dealstage IN (inbox, sequenced, engaging, responsive, advising, negotiation)

territory NOT unsupported

email is known

3. Google Ads API side

Use:

OfflineUserDataJobService

Or simpler: CustomerMatchUserListService

You upload hashed data (SHA-256) like:

{
  userIdentifiers: [
    { hashedEmail: '...' },
    { hashedPhoneNumber: '...' }
  ]
}

4. Node.js flow (simplified pseudo-code)
import axios from "axios";
import crypto from "crypto";
import { GoogleAdsApi } from "google-ads-api";

const hubspot = axios.create({
  baseURL: "https://api.hubapi.com",
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.HUBSPOT_TOKEN}` }
});

const client = new GoogleAdsApi({
  client_id: process.env.GADS_CLIENT_ID,
  client_secret: process.env.GADS_CLIENT_SECRET,
  developer_token: process.env.GADS_DEV_TOKEN
});
const customer = client.Customer({
  customer_account_id: process.env.GADS_CUSTOMER_ID,
  refresh_token: process.env.GADS_REFRESH_TOKEN
});

async function syncContacts() {
  // 1. Get HubSpot contacts
  const res = await hubspot.post("/crm/v3/objects/contacts/search", {
    filterGroups: [{
      filters: [
        { propertyName: "dealstage", operator: "IN", values: ["inbox","sequenced","engaging","responsive"] },
        { propertyName: "territory", operator: "NEQ", value: "unsupported" },
        { propertyName: "email", operator: "HAS_PROPERTY" }
      ]
    }],
    properties: ["email","phone"]
  });

  const contacts = res.data.results || [];

  // 2. Hash & format for Google
  const operations = contacts.map(c => ({
    user_identifiers: [
      { hashed_email: sha256(c.properties.email.toLowerCase().trim()) },
      ...(c.properties.phone ? [{ hashed_phone_number: sha256(c.properties.phone.replace(/\D/g,'')) }] : [])
    ]
  }));

  // 3. Push to Google Ads
  await customer.user_lists.add_members(process.env.GADS_USERLIST_ID, operations);
  console.log(`‚úÖ Synced ${operations.length} contacts`);
}

function sha256(str) {
  return crypto.createHash('sha256').update(str).digest('hex');
}

syncContacts();

üïí 5. Schedule it

Use cron or PM2 to run every 3 hours:

0 */3 * * * node /home/hub/public_html/ads/sql-sync.js >> /home/hub/public_html/ads/sql-sync.log 2>&1

‚úÖ Outcome

Every few hours, your HubSpot ‚Äúactive SQLs‚Äù automatically sync to Google Ads.

Ads start showing within hours of a lead hitting Stage 3 or 4.

No HubSpot Marketing Pro cost.

Would you like me to turn that into a ready-to-deploy script (with full .env variable setup and logging format for your /fins or /hubapp environment)?
